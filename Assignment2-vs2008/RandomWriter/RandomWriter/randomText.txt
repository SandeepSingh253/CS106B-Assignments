You can run the random writer program on any sort of input text, in any language! The web is a great
place to find an endless variety of input material (blogs, slashdot, articles, etc.) When you’re ready for

books. We’ve supplied you with files containing the text of Twain’s Tom Sawyer, William
Shakespeare’s Hamlet, and George Eliot’s Middlemarch—all of which come from Project Gutenberg.
At higher orders of analysis, the results the random writer produces from these sources can be
surprisingly sensible and often amusing
